    "Assume you have been hired as a Data Engineer for an organization focused on nature conservation. The organization is working on a project to monitor and protect natural habitats using satellite data, wildlife sensor data, and geospatial information. Your task is to design and implement a data pipeline that ingests, processes, and analyzes this data to help identify areas needing immediate conservation attention as well as build a model that provides helpful insights related our organization's interests."

    "The first is a design task, in which we expect you to diagram and describe how you'd set up a process to injest this data from a live streamed source, assuming you are also paying montoring services to supply this data from scratch. Think about how you might transform and store the data efficiently for querying and analysis and feed it into your model. \n",

    "## Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Design - Data Ingestion & Storage:\n",
    "- **Ingestion**: Design and implement a solution to ingest data from three different sources: GeoJSON, CSV, and JSON.\n",
    "- **Automation**: Ensure the pipeline can handle regular data updates (e.g., daily or hourly).\n",
    "- **Storage**: Choose appropriate storage solutions for each dataset (e.g., relational database, NoSQL, cloud storage, or data lake). Provide justification for your choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Data Transformation & Analysis:\n",
    "- **Data Parsing & Cleaning**: \n",
    "  - Parse and clean the wildlife tracking data (CSV) and geospatial data (GeoJSON) to ensure consistency.\n",
    "  - Ensure the data is ready for analysis by standardizing formats, removing errors, and handling missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Exploratory Data Analysis**:\n",
    "  - Investigate the data to understand key characteristics, distributions, and trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Behavioral Analysis**:\n",
    "  - Identify more complex animal behaviors:\n",
    "    - Determine when animals cross the boundaries of protected areas.\n",
    "    - Analyze potential factors contributing to these crossings (e.g., time, weather, or environmental changes).\n",
    "    - Calculate the total number of animal entries and exits from protected areas over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Advanced Insights**:\n",
    "  - Identify migration paths or clustering patterns.\n",
    "  - Build a predictive model to anticipate future animal movements or identify risk zones for endangered species.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Optional Bonus - Visualization/Reporting:\n",
    "- Provide interactive visualizations to demonstrate your analysis, ideally within this notebook."
